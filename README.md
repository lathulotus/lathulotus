# Lathursha's Profile 🧫
Hi, I'm Lathursha! I'm a Master's student passionate about genetics, genomics, and bioinformatics!

## About Me
🎓 Pursuing a Master's in **Medical Genomics (MHSc)** at the University of Toronto, where I'm exploring bioinformatic tools relevant to medical research.

🔬 Background in **Forensic Biology (HBSc)** from the University of Toronto Mississauga,  where I formally began using computational tools to solve biological challenges.

🧫 Interested in leveraging **bioinformatics** to investigate **rare diseases**, to inform **patient care**, and to develop **personalized treatment strategies**.

🧪 Driven by the goal of using **computational biology** to improve **diagnosis**, **prognosis**, and **treatment outcomes** for patients.
